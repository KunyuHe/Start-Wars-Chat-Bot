OBI-WAN	We've got to split them up.
ANAKIN	Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
OBI-WAN	Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
ANAKIN	Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
OBI-WAN	Anakin, they're all over me!
ANAKIN	Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . We got him, Artoo! I copy, Artoo.
OBI-WAN	I'm going down on the deck.
ANAKIN	Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
OBI-WAN	Hurry up! I don't like this! Ouch! Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.
ANAKIN	We're locked on ... we've got him . . . Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.
OBI-WAN	Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...
ANAKIN	Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. The one crawling with vulture droids.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
ANAKIN	Come on, Master.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .
ANAKIN	I'm going head to head. See you.
ODD BALL	I'm on your right, Red Leader.
ANAKIN	Incoming!!
OBI-WAN	Five more on the right!
ANAKIN	Here we go.
OBI-WAN	I'm going high and right.
ANAKIN	Hang on. There are four more of them.
OBI-WAN	Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.
ANAKIN	I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
OBI-WAN	All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.
ANAKIN	How many back there. Artoo?  Three . . .  Four . . . that's not good.
OBI-WAN	Anakin, you have four on your tail.
ANAKIN	I know. I know!
OBI-WAN	Four more closing from your left.
ANAKIN	I know. I know!
OBI-WAN	Break right and go high.
ANAKIN	I'm going low and left.
OBI-WAN	He still has much to learn.
ANAKIN	Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .
OBI-WAN	"Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: ""Survive."""
ANAKIN	Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.
OBI-WAN	Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left. You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.
ANAKIN	Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.
OBI-WAN	Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.
ANAKIN	Wrong thought, Artoo. I'm through.
CLONE PILOT 2	I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .
ANAKIN	I'm going to go help them out!
OBI-WAN	No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!
ANAKIN	Missiles! Pull up!
OBI-WAN	They overshot us . . .
ANAKIN	They're coming around!
OBI-WAN	All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.
ANAKIN	Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. We got 'em. Artoo!
OBI-WAN	Flying is for droids. I'm hit! Anakin?
ANAKIN	I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
OBI-WAN	Arfour, be careful. You have one . . . Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.
ANAKIN	Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
OBI-WAN	The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here. In the name of ...
ANAKIN	Steady . . . steady . . .
OBI-WAN	Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.
ANAKIN	I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .
OBI-WAN	Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.
ANAKIN	Move to the right.
OBI-WAN	Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.
ANAKIN	I'm not leaving without you, Master.
OBI-WAN	Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.
ANAKIN	Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
OBI-WAN	Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.
ANAKIN	Yeah, you got him!
OBI-WAN	Great, Artoo.
ANAKIN	Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
OBI-WAN	Have you noticed the shields are still up?
ANAKIN	Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
ANAKIN	Tap into the ship's computers.
OBI-WAN	The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.
ANAKIN	I sense Count Dooku . . .
OBI-WAN	I sense a trap.
ANAKIN	Next move?
OBI-WAN	Spring the trap.
ANAKIN	Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
===	===
OBI-WAN	We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him. Anakin. . .
ANAKIN	Ready.
===	===
OBI-WAN	. . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.
ANAKIN	Well then, we're safe for the time being.
OBI-WAN	Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
ANAKIN	They're sealing this section off.
OBI-WAN	Six droids coming our way!
ANAKIN	Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
OBI-WAN	We'll never get through that. It's too small!
ANAKIN	I found our escape vent.
OBI-WAN	Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.
ANAKIN	Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .
===	===
OBI-WAN	That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
ANAKIN	The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Did you press the stop button?
ANAKIN	No, did you?
OBI-WAN	No!
ANAKIN	Well, there's more than one way out of here.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Well, Artoo has been . . .
ANAKIN	No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
OBI-WAN	Did I say anything?
ANAKIN	He's trying!
===	===
OBI-WAN	Chancellor.
ANAKIN	Are you all right?
OBI-WAN	This time we will do it together.
ANAKIN	I was about to say that.
COUNT DOOKU	I've been looking forward to this.
ANAKIN	My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
ANAKIN	I shouldn't . . .
DARTH SIDIOUS	Do it!!
ANAKIN	... I couldn't stop myself.
DARTH SIDIOUS	You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
ANAKIN	Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
DARTH SIDIOUS	It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive. Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.
ANAKIN	He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Leave him, or we'll never make it.
ANAKIN	His fate will be the same as ours.
===	===
OBI-WAN	What is that? Oops.
ANAKIN	Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
===	===
OBI-WAN	Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.
ANAKIN	Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?
===	===
OBI-WAN	None of those ships will get us anywhere.
ANAKIN	I agree.
DARTH SIDIOUS	What are we going to do?
ANAKIN	I don't know.
OBI-WAN	Don't look at me. I don't know.
ANAKIN	Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.
ANAKIN	Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
OBI-WAN	Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.
ANAKIN	You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.
ANAKIN	I say . . . patience.
OBI-WAN	Patience! That's your plan, is it?
ANAKIN	Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . . See! No problem.
===	===
GENERAL GRIEVOUS	And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
ANAKIN	General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.
OBI-WAN	Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
ANAKIN	Artoo.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
ANAKIN	You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
OBI-WAN	Well?
ANAKIN	Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
OBI-WAN	Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
ANAKIN	Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
OBI-WAN	Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .
ANAKIN	We lost something.
OBI-WAN	Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.
ANAKIN	Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
OBI-WAN	Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .
ANAKIN	What's our speed?
OBI-WAN	Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .
ANAKIN	Grab that . . . Keep us level.
OBI-WAN	Steady. Steady.
ANAKIN	Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.
OBI-WAN	Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.
ANAKIN	We're coming in too hot.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
ANAKIN	Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
OBI-WAN	Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .
ANAKIN	All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
OBI-WAN	. . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
ANAKIN	All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
BAIL ORGANA	Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
ANAKIN	Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.
ANAKIN	I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.
BAIL ORGANA	I'll do everything I can with the Senate.
ANAKIN	Excuse me.
PADME	Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
ANAKIN	I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
PADME	There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
ANAKIN	I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
PADME	Wait, not here . . .
ANAKIN	Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
PADME	Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
ANAKIN	I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
PADME	I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
ANAKIN	Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
PADME	I'm just excited to see you.
ANAKIN	That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
PADME	Nothing . . . nothing . . .
ANAKIN	You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!
PADME	You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
ANAKIN	. . . Is there someone else?
PADME	No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
ANAKIN	I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
PADME	I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
ANAKIN	It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
PADME	Something wonderful has happened. I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.
ANAKIN	That's . . . that's wonderful.
PADME	What are we going to do?
ANAKIN	We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.
===	===
PADME	Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
ANAKIN	You are so beautiful!
PADME	It's only because I'm so in love . . .
ANAKIN	No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
PADME	So love has blinded you?
ANAKIN	Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .
PADME	But it's probably true!
ANAKIN	I haven't laughed in so long . . .
===	===
PADME	What's bothering you?
ANAKIN	Nothing . . . I remember when I gave this to you.
PADME	Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
ANAKIN	It was a dream.
PADME	Bad?
ANAKIN	Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
PADME	And?
ANAKIN	It was about you.
PADME	Tell me.
ANAKIN	It was only a dream. You die in childbirth . . .
PADME	And the baby?
ANAKIN	I don't know.
PADME	It was only a dream.
ANAKIN	. . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.
PADME	Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.
ANAKIN	I know бн.
PADME	Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
ANAKIN	Have you told him anything?
PADME	No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.
ANAKIN	He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!
PADME	I won't, Anakin.
ANAKIN	I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.
===	===
YODA	Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
ANAKIN	They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
YODA	Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
ANAKIN	Someone . . .
YODA	. . . close to you?
ANAKIN	Yes.
YODA	Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
ANAKIN	I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
YODA	Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
ANAKIN	What must I do, Master Yoda?
===	===
OBI-WAN	You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
ANAKIN	I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.
OBI-WAN	In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
ANAKIN	What's wrong then?
OBI-WAN	The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
ANAKIN	Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
OBI-WAN	Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.
ANAKIN	Be careful of what?
OBI-WAN	He has requested your presence.
ANAKIN	What for?
OBI-WAN	He would not say.
ANAKIN	He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?
OBI-WAN	All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.
ANAKIN	I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.
ANAKIN	The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
DARTH SIDIOUS	They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.
ANAKIN	I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.
DARTH SIDIOUS	There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.
ANAKIN	With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.
ANAKIN	Everyone will agree on that.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.
ANAKIN	Of course.
DARTH SIDIOUS	I need your help, son.
ANAKIN	What do you mean?
DARTH SIDIOUS	I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.
ANAKIN	I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.
ANAKIN	For what? I don't understand.
DARTH SIDIOUS	To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . . Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
ANAKIN	Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
===	===
MACE	Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.
ANAKIN	I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
YODA	Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
ANAKIN	I understand.
MACE	You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
ANAKIN	What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
MACE	Take a seat, young Skywalker.
ANAKIN	Forgive me, Master.
OBI-WAN	He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
ANAKIN	I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
ANAKIN	I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .
OBI-WAN	But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
ANAKIN	That has nothing to do with this.
OBI-WAN	Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.
ANAKIN	You mean divided loyalties.
OBI-WAN	I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.
ANAKIN	The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
OBI-WAN	No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.
ANAKIN	Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.
OBI-WAN	I hope so . . .
ANAKIN	I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
OBI-WAN	Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
ANAKIN	And?
OBI-WAN	Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.
ANAKIN	What situation?
OBI-WAN	The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
ANAKIN	They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
OBI-WAN	We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.
ANAKIN	Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
OBI-WAN	This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
ANAKIN	The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
OBI-WAN	That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
ANAKIN	Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
OBI-WAN	Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
ANAKIN	You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
===	===
PADME	Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
ANAKIN	Beautiful, isn't it?
PADME	You startled me.
ANAKIN	How are you feeling?
PADME	He keeps kicking.
ANAKIN	He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
PADME	My motherly intuition.
ANAKIN	Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
PADME	I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
ANAKIN	I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
PADME	Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
ANAKIN	They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
PADME	Anakin . . .
ANAKIN	Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
PADME	Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
ANAKIN	What do you mean?
PADME	What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
ANAKIN	I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
PADME	Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
ANAKIN	Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
PADME	What is it?
ANAKIN	Nothing.
PADME	Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
ANAKIN	You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.
ANAKIN	At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
DARTH SIDIOUS	I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far бн but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.
ANAKIN	They try.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Sit down,  Leave us. Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
ANAKIN	I'm not sure I understand.
DARTH SIDIOUS	You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.
ANAKIN	I don't think . . .
DARTH SIDIOUS	Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?
ANAKIN	I know they don't trust you . . .
DARTH SIDIOUS	Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.
ANAKIN	I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
ANAKIN	I don't know ... I don't know what to say.
DARTH SIDIOUS	"Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. ""All those who gain power are afraid to lose it."" Even the Jedi."
ANAKIN	The Jedi use their power for good.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .
ANAKIN	. . . evil.
DARTH SIDIOUS	. . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
ANAKIN	The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
DARTH SIDIOUS	And the Jedi don't?
ANAKIN	The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?
ANAKIN	I'm not sure it's wrong.
DARTH SIDIOUS	"Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith. Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""?"
ANAKIN	No.
DARTH SIDIOUS	I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
ANAKIN	He could actually save people from death?
DARTH SIDIOUS	The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
ANAKIN	What happened to him?
DARTH SIDIOUS	He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.  Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
ANAKIN	Is it possible to learn this power?
===	===
MACE	How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.
ANAKIN	A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
OBI-WAN	Does everyone agree?
ANAKIN	The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
MACE	Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.
ANAKIN	He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous. No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
ANAKIN	Master! Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
OBI-WAN	You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master. Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.
ANAKIN	Well, there's always a first time. Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?
ANAKIN	He will soon have Grievous's head.
DARTH SIDIOUS	We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.
ANAKIN	The Council was very sure in its decision.
===	===
JAR JAR	Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .
ANAKIN	Hi, Jar Jar.
DARTH SIDIOUS	There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.
ANAKIN	Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
DARTH SIDIOUS	They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.
ANAKIN	That's ridiculous. Who?!?
DARTH SIDIOUS	No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.
ANAKIN	That's impossible. I would know.
===	===
PADME	He came by this morning.
ANAKIN	What did he want?
PADME	He's worried about you.
ANAKIN	You told him about us, didn't you?
PADME	He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
ANAKIN	And he's not?
PADME	You have been moody lately.
ANAKIN	I'm not moody . . .
PADME	Anakin! Don't do this again.
ANAKIN	I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
PADME	Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
PADME	They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
ANAKIN	Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
PADME	You expect too much of yourself.
ANAKIN	I have found a way to save you.
PADME	Save me?
ANAKIN	From my nightmares.
PADME	Is that what's bothering you?
ANAKIN	I won't lose you, Padme.
PADME	I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
ANAKIN	No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator. Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.
ANAKIN	What do you mean?
DARTH SIDIOUS	They are not to be trusted.
ANAKIN	Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
DARTH SIDIOUS	These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.
ANAKIN	I'm sure you're mistaken.
DARTH SIDIOUS	I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.
ANAKIN	I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
===	===
MACE WINDU	Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
ANAKIN	Yes, Master.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
ANAKIN	I should be there with him.
DARTH SIDIOUS	It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
ANAKIN	I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
DARTH SIDIOUS	They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
ANAKIN	How do you know the ways of the Force?
DARTH SIDIOUS	My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.
ANAKIN	You know the dark side?!?
DARTH SIDIOUS	Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.  They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
ANAKIN	I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
ANAKIN	What did you say?
DARTH SIDIOUS	Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .
ANAKIN	You're a Sith Lord!
DARTH SIDIOUS	I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.
ANAKIN	You're wrong!
DARTH SIDIOUS	Are you going to kill me?
ANAKIN	I would certainly like to.
DARTH SIDIOUS	I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
ANAKIN	I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?
ANAKIN	I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
===	===
MACE WINDU	What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
ANAKIN	He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU	A Sith Lord?
ANAKIN	Yes. The one we have been looking for.
MACE WINDU	How do you know this?
ANAKIN	He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
MACE WINDU	Are you sure?
ANAKIN	Absolutely.
MACE WINDU	Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
ANAKIN	Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
MACE WINDU	For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
ANAKIN	I must go, Master.
MACE WINDU	No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
ANAKIN	Yes, Master.
MACE WINDU	Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.
ANAKIN	Yes, Master.
===	===
C-3PO	My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
ANAKIN	I can't do this ... I can't let her die.
===	===
MACE WINDU	You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
ANAKIN	You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.
DARTH SIDIOUS	I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.
ANAKIN	It is not the Jedi way . . . He must live . . .
DARTH SIDIOUS	Please don't, please don't . . .
ANAKIN	I need him . . .
DARTH SIDIOUS	Please don't . . .
ANAKIN	NO!!!
DARTH SIDIOUS	Power! Unlimited power!
ANAKIN	What have I done?
DARTH SIDIOUS	You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
ANAKIN	I will do whatever you ask.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good.
ANAKIN	Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.
DARTH SIDIOUS	To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
ANAKIN	I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.
ANAKIN	Thank you. my Master.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.
ANAKIN	I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?
ANAKIN	I understand, Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS	We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
ANAKIN	What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
===	===
PADME	Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
ANAKIN	I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
C-3PO	What is going on? You can't be anymore confused than I am.
ANAKIN	The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
PADME	I can't believe that!
ANAKIN	I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
PADME	Anakin, what are you going to do?
ANAKIN	I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
PADME	What about Obi-Wan?
ANAKIN	I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
PADME	How could this have happened?
ANAKIN	The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
PADME	What are you saying?
ANAKIN	You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
PADME	What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
ANAKIN	That won't happen. I won't let it.
PADME	Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
ANAKIN	Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise. Please, wait for me.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I must know the truth, Master. It can't be . . . It can't be . . .
ANAKIN	The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?
ANAKIN	Yes, My Master.
===	===
PADME	Oh, Anakin!
ANAKIN	It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
PADME	I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
ANAKIN	What things?
PADME	He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
PADME	He cares about us.
ANAKIN	Us??!
PADME	He knows . . . He wants to help you.
ANAKIN	Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
PADME	Anakin, all I want is your love.
ANAKIN	Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
PADME	At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
ANAKIN	I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
PADME	Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
ANAKIN	Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
PADME	I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
ANAKIN	I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
PADME	I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
ANAKIN	Because of Obi-Wan?
PADME	Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
ANAKIN	Liar!
PADME	No!
ANAKIN	You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
OBI-WAN	Let her go, Anakin.
ANAKIN	What have you and she been up to?
OBI-WAN	Let her go!
ANAKIN	You turned her against me.
OBI-WAN	You have done that yourself.
ANAKIN	You will not take her from me.
OBI-WAN	Your anger and your lust for power have already done that. You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
ANAKIN	Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
OBI-WAN	Your new Empire?
ANAKIN	Don't make me kill you.
OBI-WAN	Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.
ANAKIN	If you're not with me, you're my enemy.
OBI-WAN	Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
ANAKIN	You will try.
===	===
OBI-WAN	The flaw of power is arrogance.
ANAKIN	You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.
ANAKIN	I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
OBI-WAN	From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
ANAKIN	From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
OBI-WAN	Well, then you are lost!
ANAKIN	This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
OBI-WAN	It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
ANAKIN	You underestimate my power!
OBI-WAN	Don't try it. . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
ANAKIN	I hate you!
===	===
JAR JAR	Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodiaclect... speak it like a native now. Don't really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it... ...and this, I take it, is your apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie? Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen.
ANAKIN	Hi, Jar Jar.
===	===
PADME	Annie?? My goodness you've grown.
ANAKIN	So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
OBI-WAN	We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.
ANAKIN	We will find out who is trying to kill you Padme, I promise you.
OBI-WAN	We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.
ANAKIN	I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
OBI-WAN	We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead.
ANAKIN	Why?
OBI-WAN	What??!!
ANAKIN	Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.
JAR JAR	Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad times, bombad times.
ANAKIN	She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely.
OBI-WAN	Anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now lets check the security here.
ANAKIN	Yes, my master.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?
ANAKIN	Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
OBI-WAN	What's going on?
ANAKIN	She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.
OBI-WAN	What is she thinking?
ANAKIN	She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.
OBI-WAN	It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.
ANAKIN	I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?
OBI-WAN	You're using her as bait??
ANAKIN	It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
OBI-WAN	It's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice.
ANAKIN	And yours are?
===	===
OBI-WAN	You look tired.
ANAKIN	I don't sleep well, anymore.
OBI-WAN	Because of your mother?
ANAKIN	I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little.
OBI-WAN	Dreams pass in time.
ANAKIN	I'd rather dream of Padme. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.
OBI-WAN	Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.
ANAKIN	She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.
OBI-WAN	It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.
ANAKIN	Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
OBI-WAN	Palpatine's a politician, I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.
ANAKIN	I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about...
===	===
OBI-WAN	I have a bad feeling about this.
ANAKIN	That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
OBI-WAN	What took you so long?
ANAKIN	Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color...
OBI-WAN	If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
ANAKIN	I thought I already did.
OBI-WAN	Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!
ANAKIN	Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.
OBI-WAN	I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!
ANAKIN	Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this.
OBI-WAN	Just slow down! Wait! Don't go in there! You know I don't like it when you do that!
ANAKIN	Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now!
OBI-WAN	What are you doing? He's gonna blast me!
ANAKIN	Right - this isn't working.
OBI-WAN	That was too close!
ANAKIN	Clear that!
OBI-WAN	What??
ANAKIN	Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry!
OBI-WAN	Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't  like it when you do that!
ANAKIN	So sorry, Master.
OBI-WAN	It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there! Yiiii, what are you doing?
ANAKIN	Sorry, Master!
OBI-WAN	Oh, that was good...
ANAKIN	That was crazy!!! Ahh, damn.
OBI-WAN	Stop!!
ANAKIN	No, we can make it.
OBI-WAN	I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm crazy.
ANAKIN	But it worked... we made it.
OBI-WAN	It didn't work... we've stalled! And you almost got us killed!
ANAKIN	I think we're still alive.
OBI-WAN	It was stupid!
ANAKIN	I could have made it...
OBI-WAN	But you didn't!!! And now we've lost him.
ANAKIN	No we didn't...
OBI-WAN	Where are you going?! He went down there, the other way.
ANAKIN	This is a shortcut... I think.
OBI-WAN	What do you mean, 'You think?' What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You've lost him!
ANAKIN	Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep's gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I'd very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he's working for...
OBI-WAN	Oh, so that's why we're going in the wrong direction. Well, you lost him.
ANAKIN	I'm deeply sorry, Master. Excuse me for a moment.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Anakin!
ANAKIN	She went into that club, Master.
OBI-WAN	Patience. Here. Next time try not to lose it.
ANAKIN	Sorry, Master.
OBI-WAN	A Jedi's saber is his most precious possession.
ANAKIN	Yes, Master.
OBI-WAN	He must keep it with him at all times.
ANAKIN	I know, Master.
OBI-WAN	This weapon is your life!
ANAKIN	I've heard this lesson before...
OBI-WAN	But, you haven't learned anything, Anakin.
ANAKIN	I try, Master.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?!
ANAKIN	Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.
OBI-WAN	Then why don't you listen to me?!
ANAKIN	I will. I'll do better, I promise.
OBI-WAN	Do you see him him?
ANAKIN	I think he's a she...
OBI-WAN	Then be extra careful... Check it out.
ANAKIN	Where are you going, Master?
ELAN	I want to go home and rethink my life.
ANAKIN	Easy... Official business. Go back to your drinks.
===	===
ZAM WESSEL	It was just a job.
ANAKIN	Tell us!
OBI-WAN	This wound's going to need treatment.
ANAKIN	Who hired you? Tell us... tell us now!
===	===
PADME	I do not like this idea of hiding.
ANAKIN	Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
PADME	"I haven't worked for a year to defeat the ""Military Creation Act"" not to be here when its fate is decided."
ANAKIN	Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
PADME	Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
ANAKIN	Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying to...
PADME	Annie! No!
ANAKIN	Please don't call me that.
PADME	What?
ANAKIN	Annie...
PADME	I've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?
ANAKIN	It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.
PADME	I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've... ...that you've grown up.
ANAKIN	Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...
PADME	Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
ANAKIN	Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.
PADME	That must be frustrating.
ANAKIN	It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!
PADME	I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way.
ANAKIN	I'm not whining! I'm not.
PADME	I didn't say it to hurt you.
ANAKIN	I know...
PADME	Anakin... Don't try to grow up too fast.
ANAKIN	I am grown up. You said it yourself.
PADME	Please don't look at me like that.
ANAKIN	Why not?
PADME	Because I can see what you're thinking.
ANAKIN	Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?
PADME	It makes me feel uncomfortable.
ANAKIN	Sorry, M'lady.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.
ANAKIN	Yes, Master.
PADME	I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
ANAKIN	Time to go.
OBI-WAN	May the Force be with you.
ANAKIN	May the Force be with you, Master.
PADME	Suddenly, I'm afraid...
ANAKIN	I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.
===	===
FOOD SERVER	Hey! No Droids!
ANAKIN	No, no, Mom, no... What?
PADME	You seemed to be having a nightmare. Are you hungry?
ANAKIN	Thank you.
PADME	We went into lightspeed a while ago.
ANAKIN	I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...
PADME	You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
ANAKIN	I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.
PADME	It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...
ANAKIN	Or be with the people I love.
PADME	Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
ANAKIN	Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
PADME	You have changed so much
ANAKIN	You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
PADME	It hasn't...
ANAKIN	I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see. I love Naboo.
PADME	Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?
ANAKIN	Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.
===	===
PADME	I doubt that.
ANAKIN	No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...
PADME	...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.
ANAKIN	Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
PADME	"No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the ""Refugee Relief Movement."" I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the ""Apprentice Legislators"", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready."
ANAKIN	The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
PADME	Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
ANAKIN	I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
===	===
PADME	There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
ANAKIN	The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.
PADME	Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...
ANAKIN	Hey, hold on a minute!
PADME	Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
ANAKIN	Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.
PADME	Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
ANAKIN	Sorry, M'Lady.
===	===
PADME	There's my house! What? Don't say you're shy!
ANAKIN	No, but I...
===	===
SOLA	Hello, Anakin.
ANAKIN	Hello.
JOBAL	You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, Anakin.
ANAKIN	A little.
RUWEE	Is she?
ANAKIN	...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
===	===
RUWEE	Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more... but I must say, I'm happy here.
ANAKIN	Padme tells me you teach at the university?
===	===
RUWEE	Now tell me, son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?
ANAKIN	There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long.
RUWEE	I don't want anything to happen to her.
ANAKIN	I don't either.
===	===
PADME	Don't worry, this won't take long.
ANAKIN	I just want to get there before dark. You still live at home.
PADME	I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
ANAKIN	I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was. Is this you?
===	===
PADME	When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.
ANAKIN	I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
PADME	...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
ANAKIN	I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything's soft... and smooth...
PADME	There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
ANAKIN	Everything here is magical.
PADME	You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn't.
ANAKIN	Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...
PADME	I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.
ANAKIN	I think it's true...
PADME	I shouldn't have done that.
ANAKIN	I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.
PADME	It's the situation... the stress...
ANAKIN	...the view.
===	===
PADME	You did that?
ANAKIN	What?
PADME	That! Now stop it! Anakin!!
ANAKIN	I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy.
===	===
PADME	I don't know.
ANAKIN	Then how can I tell you?
PADME	Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
ANAKIN	It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
PADME	Anakin, don't...
ANAKIN	From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
PADME	...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
ANAKIN	Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...
PADME	You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
ANAKIN	Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
PADME	Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.
ANAKIN	I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.
PADME	I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.
ANAKIN	It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
PADME	Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?
ANAKIN	...No, you're right. It would destroy us.
===	===
PADME	I don't know...
ANAKIN	Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.
PADME	Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
ANAKIN	They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.
PADME	All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.
ANAKIN	All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?
PADME	I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
ANAKIN	Maybe he was the smart one.
PADME	You really don't like politicians, do you?
ANAKIN	I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.
PADME	How would you have it work?
ANAKIN	We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
PADME	That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
ANAKIN	Then they should be made to.
PADME	By whom? Who's going to make them?
ANAKIN	I don't know. Someone.
PADME	You?
ANAKIN	Of course not me.
PADME	But someone.
ANAKIN	Someone wise.
PADME	That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
ANAKIN	Well, if it works...
PADME	You're making fun of me.
ANAKIN	On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.
PADME	You're so bad!
ANAKIN	You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.
===	===
PAMDE	I don't want to disturb you.
ANAKIN	Your presence is soothing.
PADME	You had a nightmare again last night.
ANAKIN	Jedi don't have nightmares.
PADME	I heard you.
ANAKIN	I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.
PADME	Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate.
ANAKIN	What about Master Obi-wan?
===	===
WATTO	No, not that one - that one!
ANAKIN	Excuse me, Watto.
WATTO	What?
ANAKIN	I said excuse me.
WATTO	Shut down. What? I don't know you... What can I do for you? You look like a Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't do it.
ANAKIN	Let me help you with that. I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
WATTO	Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!! You are Annie! It is you! You little womp rat. You sure sprouted Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you couldda help wit some daedbeats who owe...
ANAKIN	My mother...
WATTO	Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine no more. I sold her.
ANAKIN	Sold her...
WATTO	Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that?
ANAKIN	Do you know where they are?
WATTO	Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think...
ANAKIN	I'd like to know.
===	===
C-3PO	Good evening. May I help you?
ANAKIN	Threepio?
PADME	Hello, Threepio.
ANAKIN	I've come to see my mother.
===	===
C-3PO	Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you!
ANAKIN	I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.
OWEN	I had a feeling you might show up some day.
ANAKIN	Is my mother here?
===	===
OWEN	Where are you going?
ANAKIN	To find my mother.
CLIEGG	She's daed, son. Accept it.
ANAKIN	I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive.
===	===
PADME	Anakin...
ANAKIN	I trust you'll watch over her, Owen.
OWEN	Don't worry.
ANAKIN	I won't be long.
===	===
SHMI	Annie...? Is it you?
ANAKIN	I'm here, Mom. You're safe. Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here...
SHMI	I'm so glad... to see you, Annie... Now... I am complete...
ANAKIN	Just stay with me, Mom. I'm going to make you well again. Everything's going to be fine.
===	===
OBI-WAN	...Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... ah... attack... I don't... make it... aaaggghhh!
ANAKIN	I'm going after him!
PADME	I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.
ANAKIN	Yeah, you're right, you're right.
===	===
MACE WINDU	We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority.
ANAKIN	Understood, Master.
PADME	They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
ANAKIN	If he's still alive.
PADME	Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...
ANAKIN	...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
===	===
PADME	To find Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN	No! You're not!
PADME	Let go of me!
ANAKIN	I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
PADME	What?!?
ANAKIN	It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
===	===
PADME	I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
ANAKIN	What are you talking about?
PADME	I love you.
ANAKIN	You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...
PADME	I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.
ANAKIN	I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.
===	===
OBI-WAN	I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.
ANAKIN	I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.
POGGLE	Let the executions begin!
ANAKIN	I have a bad feeling about this.
OBI-WAN	Take the one the left. I'll take the one on the right.
ANAKIN	What about Padme?
NUTE GUNRAY	Foul!! She can't do that... shoot her or something!
ANAKIN	You okay?
PADME	Sure! Well, sort of.
ANAKIN	Jump!!!
===	===
OBI-WAN	Hold on! Look over there...
ANAKIN	It's Dooku, go after him! Padme!!! Put the ship down! Down!
OBI-WAN	No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku.
ANAKIN	No we're not!! Land this ship!
OBI-WAN	Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do.
ANAKIN	I don't care!.. Go back.
===	===
OBI-WAN	We move in together - you slowly on the...
ANAKIN	I'm taking him now!
OBI-WAN	Anakin, no!
ANAKIN	You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku.
COUNT DOOKU	Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. Surely you can do better...? No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? Which is it? come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. That's brave of you, boy - but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson.
ANAKIN	I'm a slow learner.
COUNT DOOKU	You have unusual powers, young Padawan. But not enought to save you this time.
ANAKIN	Don't bet on it!
===	===
IMPERIAL OFFICER	The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
ANAKIN	Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
REBEL OFFICER	We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
ANAKIN	If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!
===	===
LEIA	Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
ANAKIN	Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
LEIA	I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
ANAKIN	You're a part of the Rebel Alliance ... and a traitor.  Take her away!
COMMANDER	Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
ANAKIN	I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
COMMANDER	She'll die before she├Хll tell you anything.
ANAKIN	Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
SECOND OFFICER	Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
ANAKIN	She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.
===	===
TAGGE	And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
ANAKIN	The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
MOTTI	Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!
ANAKIN	Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
MOTTI	Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
ANAKIN	I find your lack of faith disturbing.
TARKIN	Enough of this!  Vader, release him!
ANAKIN	As you wish.
===	===
TARKIN	Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
ANAKIN	What do you mean?
===	===
TARKIN	She lied!  She lied to us!
ANAKIN	I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
===	===
VOICE	We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
ANAKIN	They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.
===	===
OFFICER	There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
ANAKIN	Did you find any droids?
OFFICER	No, sir.  If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
ANAKIN	Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
OFFICER	Yes, sir.
ANAKIN	I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
===	===
TARKIN	Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?
ANAKIN	A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
TARKIN	Surely he must be dead by now.
ANAKIN	Don't underestimate the Force.
TARKIN	The princess!  Put all sections on alert!
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.
TARKIN	If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
ANAKIN	Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.
===	===
OBI-WAN	Only a master of evil, Darth.
ANAKIN	Your powers are weak, old man.
===	===
TARKIN	Are they away?
ANAKIN	They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
===	===
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE	Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
ANAKIN	This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
===	===
ASTRO-OFFICER	We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
ANAKIN	We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.
===	===
JERJERROD	Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
ANAKIN	You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
JERJERROD	I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
ANAKIN	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
JERJERROD	I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
ANAKIN	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
JERJERROD	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
ANAKIN	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
JERJERROD	The Emperor's coming here?
ANAKIN	That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
JERJERROD	We shall double our efforts.
ANAKIN	I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Rise, my friend.
ANAKIN	The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
DARTH SIDIOUS	You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
ANAKIN	Yes, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
ANAKIN	As you wish.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
ANAKIN	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
DARTH SIDIOUS	It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
ANAKIN	Yes, my Master.
===	===
PILOT VOICE	Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.
ANAKIN	Do they have a code clearance?
PIETT	It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them?
ANAKIN	No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.
===	===
GUARD	Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.
ANAKIN	(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the Force) The Emperor will see me, now!
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	I told you to remain on the command ship.
ANAKIN	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Yes, I know.
ANAKIN	My son is with them.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Are you sure?
ANAKIN	I have felt him, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
ANAKIN	They are clear, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
ANAKIN	He will come to me?
DARTH SIDIOUS	I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.
ANAKIN	As you wish.
===	===
COMMANDER	This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this.
ANAKIN	Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.
COMMANDER	Yes, my Lord.
ANAKIN	The Emperor has been expecting you.
LUKE	I know, father.
ANAKIN	So, you have accepted the truth.
LUKE	I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.
ANAKIN	That name no longer has any meaning for me.
LUKE	It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
ANAKIN	I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.
LUKE	Come with me.
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
ANAKIN	If that is your destiny.
LUKE	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
ANAKIN	It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
ANAKIN	His lightsaber.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Your faith in your friends is yours.
ANAKIN	It is pointless to resist, my son.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you.
ANAKIN	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
LUKE	I will not fight you, father.
ANAKIN	You are unwise to lower your defenses.
LUKE	Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
ANAKIN	There is no conflict.
LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
ANAKIN	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
===	===
LUKE	I will not fight you.
ANAKIN	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
===	===
LURE	But you'll die.
ANAKIN	Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me.
LUKE	No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
ANAKIN	You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right.
===	===
PIETT	But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.
ANAKIN	You found something?
PIETT	Yes, my lord.
ANAKIN	That's it. The Rebels are there.
OZZEL	My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be...
ANAKIN	That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.
===	===
VEERS	My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.
ANAKIN	The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.
VEERS	He felt surprise was wiser...
ANAKIN	He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.
OZZEL	Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh!
ANAKIN	You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.
PIETT	Yes, my lord.
ANAKIN	Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
===	===
PIETT	Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...
ANAKIN	Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses.
===	===
NEEDA	...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.
ANAKIN	No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.
PIETT	Lord Vader.
ANAKIN	Yes, Admiral, what is it?
PIETT	The Emperor commands you make contact with him.
ANAKIN	Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	There is a great disturbance in the Force.
ANAKIN	I have felt it.
DARTH SIDIOUS	We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.
ANAKIN	Yes, my master.
DARTH SIDIOUS	He could destroy us.
ANAKIN	He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
DARTH SIDIOUS	The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.
ANAKIN	If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.
DARTH SIDIOUS	Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?
ANAKIN	He will join us or die, my master.
===	===
PIETT	Right.
ANAKIN	...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.
===	===
PIETT	Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.
ANAKIN	Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory.
PIETT	Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
ANAKIN	Don't fail me again, Admiral.
===	===
LANDO	Lord Vader.
ANAKIN	You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.
BOBA FETT	He's no good to me dead.
ANAKIN	He will not be permanently damaged.
LANDO	Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?
ANAKIN	They must never again leave this city.
LANDO	That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
ANAKIN	Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
LANDO	No.
ANAKIN	Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
===	===
IMPERIAL SOLDIER	Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.
ANAKIN	Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
LANDO	Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him.
ANAKIN	I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.
===	===
BOBA FETT	What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
ANAKIN	The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
C-3PO	What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.
ANAKIN	Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
LANDO	Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.
ANAKIN	He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
IMPERIAL OFFICER	Skywalker has just landed, my lord.
ANAKIN	Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
LANDO	You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
ANAKIN	I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
===	===
LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
ANAKIN	Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
LUKE	No!
ANAKIN	All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.
===	===
LUKE	I'll never join you!
ANAKIN	If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
LUKE	He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
ANAKIN	No. I am your father.
LUKE	No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
ANAKIN	Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
LUKE	No! No! No!
ANAKIN	Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.
===	===
PIETT	They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
ANAKIN	Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?
PIETT	Yes, my lord.
ANAKIN	Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun.
