We've got to split them up.
Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
Anakin, they're all over me!
Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . We got him, Artoo! I copy, Artoo.
I'm going down on the deck.
Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
Hurry up! I don't like this! Ouch! Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.
We're locked on ... we've got him . . . Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.
Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...
Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. The one crawling with vulture droids.
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
Come on, Master.
Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .
I'm going head to head. See you.
I'm on your right, Red Leader.
Incoming!!
Five more on the right!
Here we go.
I'm going high and right.
Hang on. There are four more of them.
Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.
I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.
How many back there. Artoo?  Three . . .  Four . . . that's not good.
Anakin, you have four on your tail.
I know. I know!
Four more closing from your left.
I know. I know!
Break right and go high.
I'm going low and left.
He still has much to learn.
Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .
Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."
Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.
Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left. You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.
Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.
Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.
Wrong thought, Artoo. I'm through.
I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .
I'm going to go help them out!
No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!
Missiles! Pull up!
They overshot us . . .
They're coming around!
All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.
Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. We got 'em. Artoo!
Flying is for droids. I'm hit! Anakin?
I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
Arfour, be careful. You have one . . . Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.
Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here. In the name of ...
Steady . . . steady . . .
Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.
I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .
Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.
Move to the right.
Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.
I'm not leaving without you, Master.
Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.
Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.
Yeah, you got him!
Great, Artoo.
Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
Have you noticed the shields are still up?
Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
Tap into the ship's computers.
The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.
I sense Count Dooku . . .
I sense a trap.
Next move?
Spring the trap.
Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him. Anakin. . .
Ready.
. . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.
Well then, we're safe for the time being.
Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
They're sealing this section off.
Six droids coming our way!
Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
We'll never get through that. It's too small!
I found our escape vent.
Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.
Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .
That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
Did you press the stop button?
No, did you?
No!
Well, there's more than one way out of here.
Well, Artoo has been . . .
No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
Did I say anything?
He's trying!
Chancellor.
Are you all right?
This time we will do it together.
I was about to say that.
I've been looking forward to this.
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
I shouldn't . . .
Do it!!
... I couldn't stop myself.
You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive. Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.
He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.
Leave him, or we'll never make it.
His fate will be the same as ours.
What is that? Oops.
Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.
Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?
None of those ships will get us anywhere.
I agree.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
Don't look at me. I don't know.
Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.
Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.
You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.
I say . . . patience.
Patience! That's your plan, is it?
Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . . See! No problem.
And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.
Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
Artoo.
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
Well?
Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .
We lost something.
Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.
Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .
What's our speed?
Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .
Grab that . . . Keep us level.
Steady. Steady.
Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.
Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.
We're coming in too hot.
Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .
All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
. . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.
I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.
I'll do everything I can with the Senate.
Excuse me.
Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
Wait, not here . . .
Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
I'm just excited to see you.
That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
Nothing . . . nothing . . .
You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!
You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
. . . Is there someone else?
No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
Something wonderful has happened. I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.
That's . . . that's wonderful.
What are we going to do?
We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.
Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
You are so beautiful!
It's only because I'm so in love . . .
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
So love has blinded you?
Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .
But it's probably true!
I haven't laughed in so long . . .
What's bothering you?
Nothing . . . I remember when I gave this to you.
Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
It was a dream.
Bad?
Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
And?
It was about you.
Tell me.
It was only a dream. You die in childbirth . . .
And the baby?
I don't know.
It was only a dream.
. . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.
Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.
I know бн.
Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
Have you told him anything?
No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.
He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!
I won't, Anakin.
I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.
Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
Someone . . .
. . . close to you?
Yes.
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
What must I do, Master Yoda?
You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.
In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
What's wrong then?
The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.
Be careful of what?
He has requested your presence.
What for?
He would not say.
He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?
All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.
I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?
Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.
The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.
I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.
There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.
With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.
Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.
Everyone will agree on that.
Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.
Of course.
I need your help, son.
What do you mean?
I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.
I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.
Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.
For what? I don't understand.
To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . . Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.
I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
I understand.
You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Forgive me, Master.
He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .
But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
That has nothing to do with this.
Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.
You mean divided loyalties.
I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.
The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.
Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.
I hope so . . .
I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
And?
Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.
What situation?
The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.
Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
Beautiful, isn't it?
You startled me.
How are you feeling?
He keeps kicking.
He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
My motherly intuition.
Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
Anakin . . .
Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
What do you mean?
What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
What is it?
Nothing.
Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.
At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far бн but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.
They try.
Sit down,  Leave us. Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
I'm not sure I understand.
You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.
I don't think . . .
Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?
I know they don't trust you . . .
Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.
I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
I don't know ... I don't know what to say.
Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.
The Jedi use their power for good.
Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .
. . . evil.
. . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
And the Jedi don't?
The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?
I'm not sure it's wrong.
Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith. Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
No.
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
He could actually save people from death?
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
What happened to him?
He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.  Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
Is it possible to learn this power?
How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.
A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
Does everyone agree?
The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.
He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous. No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
Master! Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master. Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.
Well, there's always a first time. Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?
He will soon have Grievous's head.
We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.
The Council was very sure in its decision.
Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .
Hi, Jar Jar.
There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.
Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.
That's ridiculous. Who?!?
No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.
That's impossible. I would know.
He came by this morning.
What did he want?
He's worried about you.
You told him about us, didn't you?
He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
And he's not?
You have been moody lately.
I'm not moody . . .
Anakin! Don't do this again.
I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
You expect too much of yourself.
I have found a way to save you.
Save me?
From my nightmares.
Is that what's bothering you?
I won't lose you, Padme.
I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.
I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator. Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.
What do you mean?
They are not to be trusted.
Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.
I'm sure you're mistaken.
I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.
I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
Yes, Master.
We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
I should be there with him.
It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
How do you know the ways of the Force?
My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.
You know the dark side?!?
Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.  They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
What did you say?
Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .
You're a Sith Lord!
I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.
You're wrong!
Are you going to kill me?
I would certainly like to.
I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?
I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
A Sith Lord?
Yes. The one we have been looking for.
How do you know this?
He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
I must go, Master.
No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
Yes, Master.
Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.
Yes, Master.
My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
I can't do this ... I can't let her die.
You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.
I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.
It is not the Jedi way . . . He must live . . .
Please don't, please don't . . .
I need him . . .
Please don't . . .
NO!!!
Power! Unlimited power!
What have I done?
You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
I will do whatever you ask.
Good.
Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.
To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.
Thank you. my Master.
Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.
I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.
Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?
I understand, Master.
We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
What is going on? You can't be anymore confused than I am.
The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
I can't believe that!
I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
Anakin, what are you going to do?
I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
What about Obi-Wan?
I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
How could this have happened?
The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
What are you saying?
You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
That won't happen. I won't let it.
Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise. Please, wait for me.
I must know the truth, Master. It can't be . . . It can't be . . .
The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?
Yes, My Master.
Oh, Anakin!
It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
What things?
He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
He cares about us.
Us??!
He knows . . . He wants to help you.
Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
Anakin, all I want is your love.
Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
Because of Obi-Wan?
Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
Liar!
No!
You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
Let her go, Anakin.
What have you and she been up to?
Let her go!
You turned her against me.
You have done that yourself.
You will not take her from me.
Your anger and your lust for power have already done that. You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
Your new Empire?
Don't make me kill you.
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.
If you're not with me, you're my enemy.
Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
You will try.
The flaw of power is arrogance.
You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
Well, then you are lost!
This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
You underestimate my power!
Don't try it. . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
I hate you!
Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodiaclect... speak it like a native now. Don't really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it... ...and this, I take it, is your apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie? Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen.
Hi, Jar Jar.
Annie?? My goodness you've grown.
So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.
We will find out who is trying to kill you Padme, I promise you.
We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.
I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead.
Why?
What??!!
Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.
Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad times, bombad times.
She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely.
Anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now lets check the security here.
Yes, my master.
Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?
Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
What's going on?
She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.
What is she thinking?
She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.
It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.
I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?
You're using her as bait??
It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
It's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice.
And yours are?
You look tired.
I don't sleep well, anymore.
Because of your mother?
I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little.
Dreams pass in time.
I'd rather dream of Padme. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.
Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.
She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.
It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.
Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
Palpatine's a politician, I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.
I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about...
I have a bad feeling about this.
That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
What took you so long?
Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color...
If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
I thought I already did.
Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!
Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.
I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!
Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this.
Just slow down! Wait! Don't go in there! You know I don't like it when you do that!
Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now!
What are you doing? He's gonna blast me!
Right - this isn't working.
That was too close!
Clear that!
What??
Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry!
Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't  like it when you do that!
So sorry, Master.
It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there! Yiiii, what are you doing?
Sorry, Master!
Oh, that was good...
That was crazy!!! Ahh, damn.
Stop!!
No, we can make it.
I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm crazy.
But it worked... we made it.
It didn't work... we've stalled! And you almost got us killed!
I think we're still alive.
It was stupid!
I could have made it...
But you didn't!!! And now we've lost him.
No we didn't...
Where are you going?! He went down there, the other way.
This is a shortcut... I think.
What do you mean, 'You think?' What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You've lost him!
Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep's gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I'd very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he's working for...
Oh, so that's why we're going in the wrong direction. Well, you lost him.
I'm deeply sorry, Master. Excuse me for a moment.
Anakin!
She went into that club, Master.
Patience. Here. Next time try not to lose it.
Sorry, Master.
A Jedi's saber is his most precious possession.
Yes, Master.
He must keep it with him at all times.
I know, Master.
This weapon is your life!
I've heard this lesson before...
But, you haven't learned anything, Anakin.
I try, Master.
Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?!
Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.
Then why don't you listen to me?!
I will. I'll do better, I promise.
Do you see him him?
I think he's a she...
Then be extra careful... Check it out.
Where are you going, Master?
I want to go home and rethink my life.
Easy... Official business. Go back to your drinks.
It was just a job.
Tell us!
This wound's going to need treatment.
Who hired you? Tell us... tell us now!
I do not like this idea of hiding.
Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
I haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is decided.
Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying to...
Annie! No!
Please don't call me that.
What?
Annie...
I've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?
It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.
I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've... ...that you've grown up.
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...
Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.
That must be frustrating.
It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!
I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way.
I'm not whining! I'm not.
I didn't say it to hurt you.
I know...
Anakin... Don't try to grow up too fast.
I am grown up. You said it yourself.
Please don't look at me like that.
Why not?
Because I can see what you're thinking.
Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
Sorry, M'lady.
Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.
Yes, Master.
I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
Time to go.
May the Force be with you.
May the Force be with you, Master.
Suddenly, I'm afraid...
I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.
Hey! No Droids!
No, no, Mom, no... What?
You seemed to be having a nightmare. Are you hungry?
Thank you.
We went into lightspeed a while ago.
I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...
You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.
It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...
Or be with the people I love.
Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
You have changed so much
You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
It hasn't...
I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see. I love Naboo.
Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?
Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.
I doubt that.
No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...
...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.
Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the "Refugee Relief Movement." I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the "Apprentice Legislators", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.
The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.
Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...
Hey, hold on a minute!
Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.
Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
Sorry, M'Lady.
There's my house! What? Don't say you're shy!
No, but I...
Hello, Anakin.
Hello.
You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, Anakin.
A little.
Is she?
...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more... but I must say, I'm happy here.
Padme tells me you teach at the university?
Now tell me, son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?
There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long.
I don't want anything to happen to her.
I don't either.
Don't worry, this won't take long.
I just want to get there before dark. You still live at home.
I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was. Is this you?
When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.
I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything's soft... and smooth...
There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
Everything here is magical.
You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn't.
Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...
I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.
I think it's true...
I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.
It's the situation... the stress...
...the view.
You did that?
What?
That! Now stop it! Anakin!!
I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy.
I don't know.
Then how can I tell you?
Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
Anakin, don't...
From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...
You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.
I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.
I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.
It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?
...No, you're right. It would destroy us.
I don't know...
Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.
Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.
All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.
All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?
I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
Maybe he was the smart one.
You really don't like politicians, do you?
I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.
How would you have it work?
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
Then they should be made to.
By whom? Who's going to make them?
I don't know. Someone.
You?
Of course not me.
But someone.
Someone wise.
That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
Well, if it works...
You're making fun of me.
On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.
You're so bad!
You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.
I don't want to disturb you.
Your presence is soothing.
You had a nightmare again last night.
Jedi don't have nightmares.
I heard you.
I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.
Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate.
What about Master Obi-wan?
No, not that one - that one!
Excuse me, Watto.
What?
I said excuse me.
Shut down. What? I don't know you... What can I do for you? You look like a Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't do it.
Let me help you with that. I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!! You are Annie! It is you! You little womp rat. You sure sprouted Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you couldda help wit some daedbeats who owe...
My mother...
Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine no more. I sold her.
Sold her...
Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that?
Do you know where they are?
Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think...
I'd like to know.
Good evening. May I help you?
Threepio?
Hello, Threepio.
I've come to see my mother.
Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you!
I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.
I had a feeling you might show up some day.
Is my mother here?
Where are you going?
To find my mother.
She's daed, son. Accept it.
I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive.
Anakin...
I trust you'll watch over her, Owen.
Don't worry.
I won't be long.
Annie...? Is it you?
I'm here, Mom. You're safe. Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here...
I'm so glad... to see you, Annie... Now... I am complete...
Just stay with me, Mom. I'm going to make you well again. Everything's going to be fine.
...Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... ah... attack... I don't... make it... aaaggghhh!
I'm going after him!
I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority.
Understood, Master.
They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
If he's still alive.
Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...
...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
To find Obi-Wan.
No! You're not!
Let go of me!
I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
What?!?
It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
What are you talking about?
I love you.
You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...
I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.
I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.
I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.
I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.
Let the executions begin!
I have a bad feeling about this.
Take the one the left. I'll take the one on the right.
What about Padme?
Foul!! She can't do that... shoot her or something!
You okay?
Sure! Well, sort of.
Jump!!!
Hold on! Look over there...
It's Dooku, go after him! Padme!!! Put the ship down! Down!
No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku.
No we're not!! Land this ship!
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do.
I don't care!.. Go back.
We move in together - you slowly on the...
I'm taking him now!
Anakin, no!
You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku.
Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. Surely you can do better...? No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? Which is it? come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. That's brave of you, boy - but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson.
I'm a slow learner.
You have unusual powers, young Padawan. But not enought to save you this time.
Don't bet on it!
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!
Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
You're a part of the Rebel Alliance ... and a traitor.  Take her away!
Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
She'll die before she├Хll tell you anything.
Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.
And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Enough of this!  Vader, release him!
As you wish.
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
What do you mean?
She lied!  She lied to us!
I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.
There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
Did you find any droids?
No, sir.  If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
Yes, sir.
I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?
A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
Surely he must be dead by now.
Don't underestimate the Force.
The princess!  Put all sections on alert!
Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.
If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.
Only a master of evil, Darth.
Your powers are weak, old man.
Are they away?
They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
The Emperor's coming here?
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
We shall double our efforts.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
Rise, my friend.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Yes, my Master.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
As you wish.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Yes, my Master.
Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.
Do they have a code clearance?
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them?
No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.
Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.
(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the Force) The Emperor will see me, now!
I told you to remain on the command ship.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Yes, I know.
My son is with them.
Are you sure?
I have felt him, my Master.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
They are clear, my Master.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
He will come to me?
I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.
As you wish.
This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this.
Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.
Yes, my Lord.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I know, father.
So, you have accepted the truth.
I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.
That name no longer has any meaning for me.
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.
Come with me.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
His lightsaber.
Your faith in your friends is yours.
It is pointless to resist, my son.
Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
I will not fight you, father.
You are unwise to lower your defenses.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
There is no conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
I will not fight you.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
But you'll die.
Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me.
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right.
But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.
You found something?
Yes, my lord.
That's it. The Rebels are there.
My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be...
That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.
My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.
The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.
He felt surprise was wiser...
He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.
Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh!
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.
Yes, my lord.
Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses.
...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.
No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.
Lord Vader.
Yes, Admiral, what is it?
The Emperor commands you make contact with him.
Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.
There is a great disturbance in the Force.
I have felt it.
We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.
Yes, my master.
He could destroy us.
He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.
If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.
Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?
He will join us or die, my master.
Right.
...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory.
Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
Don't fail me again, Admiral.
Lord Vader.
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.
He's no good to me dead.
He will not be permanently damaged.
Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?
They must never again leave this city.
That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
No.
Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.
Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him.
I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.
What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.
He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
Skywalker has just landed, my lord.
Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
No!
All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.
I'll never join you!
If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
No. I am your father.
No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
No! No! No!
Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.
They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?
Yes, my lord.
Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun.
