MACE WINDU	chancellor palpatine what a welcome sight are you all right
DARTH SIDIOUS	yes thanks to your two jedi knights they killed count dooku but general grievous has escaped once again
MACE WINDU	general grievous will run and hide as he always does he is a coward
DARTH SIDIOUS	that maybe true but with count dooku dead he is the leader of the droid army and i assure you the senate will vote to continue the war as long as grievous is alive
MACE WINDU	then the jedi council will make finding grievous our highest priority
BAIL ORGANA	skywalker the republic cannot praise you enough
ANAKIN	thank you senator organa the kidnapping was a bold move by the separatists but it was a mistake that obiwan and i were able to take advantage of
C-3PO	it couldcan not possibly be as bad as all that well there i agree with you in fact i could do with a tuneup myself
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	the end of count dooku will surely bring an end to this war and an end to the chancellor will draconian security measures
ANAKIN	i wish that were so but the fighting is going to continue until general grievous is spare parts   the chancellor is very clear about that

PADME	and the baby
ANAKIN	i docan not know
PADME	it was only a dream
ANAKIN	  i will not let this one become real padme
PADME	anakin this baby will change our lives i doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate and if the council discovers you are the father you will be expelled from the jedi order
ANAKIN	i know бн
PADME	anakin do you think obiwan might be able to help us
ANAKIN	have you told him anything
PADME	no but he will your mentor your best friend   he must suspect something
ANAKIN	he will been a father to me but he will still on the council docan not tell him anything
PADME	i will not anakin

===	===
YODA	premonitions   premonitions   hmmmm   these visions you have

YODA	yourself you speak of or someone you know
ANAKIN	someone  
YODA	  close to you
ANAKIN	yes
YODA	careful you must be when sensing the future anakin the fear of loss is a path to the dark side
ANAKIN	i will not let these visions come true master yoda
YODA	death is a natural part of life rejoice for those around you who transform into the force mourn them do not miss them do not attachment leads to jealousy the shadow of greed that is
ANAKIN	what must i do master yoda
YODA	train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose
===	===
OBI-WAN	you missed the report on the outer rim sieges
ANAKIN	ilet us sorry i was held up i have no excuse
OBI-WAN	in short they are going very well saleucami has fallen and master vos has moved his troops to boz pity
ANAKIN	what will wrong then
OBI-WAN	the senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today
ANAKIN	well that can only mean less deliberating and more action is that bad it will make it easier for us to end this war
OBI-WAN	anakin be careful of your friend palpatine
ANAKIN	be careful of what
OBI-WAN	he has requested your presence
ANAKIN	what for
OBI-WAN	he would not say
ANAKIN	he didcan not inform the jedi council that will unusual iscan not it
OBI-WAN	all of this is unusual and it will making me feel uneasy you am probably aware that relations between the council and the chancellor are stressed
ANAKIN	i know the council has grown wary of the chancellor will power mine also for that matter arecan not we all working together to save the republic why all this distrust
OBI-WAN	the force grows dark anakin and we are all affected by it be wary of your feelings
===	===
DARTH SIDIOUS	anakin this afternoon the senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the jedi council
ANAKIN	the jedi will no longer report to the senate
DARTH SIDIOUS	they will report to me   personally the senate is too unfocused to conduct a war this will bring a quick end to things
ANAKIN	i agree but the jedi council may not see it that way
DARTH SIDIOUS	there are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security
ANAKIN	with all due respect sir the council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments
DARTH SIDIOUS	thank you my friend but in this case i have no choice   this war must be won
ANAKIN	everyone will agree on that
DARTH SIDIOUS	anakin i are known you since you were a small boy i have advised you over the years when i could   i am very proud of your accomplishments you have won many battles the jedi council thought were lost   and you saved my life i hope you trust me anakin
ANAKIN	of course
DARTH SIDIOUS	i need your help son
ANAKIN	what do you mean
DARTH SIDIOUS	i fear the jedi the council keeps pushing for more control they am shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy   ideals i find simply incomprehensible in a democracy
ANAKIN	i can assure you that the jedi are dedicated to the values of the republic sir
DARTH SIDIOUS	nevertheless their actions will speak more loudly than their words ilet us depending on you
ANAKIN	for what i docan not understand
DARTH SIDIOUS	to be the eyes ears and voice of the republic   anakin   ilet us appointing you to be my personal representative on the jedi council
ANAKIN	me a master i am overwhelmed sir but the council elects its own members they will never accept this
DARTH SIDIOUS	i think they will   they need you more than you know
===	===
BAIL ORGANA	now that he has control of the jedi council the chancellor has appointed governors to oversee all star systems in the republic
FANG ZAR	when did this happen
BAIL ORGANA	the decree was posted this morning
PADME	do you think he will dismantle the senate
MON MOTHMA	why bother as a practical matter the senate no longer exists
GIDDEAN DANU	the constitution is in shreds amendment after amendment   executive directives sometimes a dozen in one day
BAIL ORGANA	we  had let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight
TERR TANEEL	what are you suggesting
BAIL ORGANA	i apologize i didcan not mean to sound like a separatist
MON MOTHMA	we are not separatists trying to leave the republic we are loyalists trying to preserve democracy in the republic
BAIL ORGANA	it has become increasingly clear to many of us that the chancellor has become an enemy of democracy
PADME	i  had believe it has come to this chancellor palpatine is one of my oldest advisors he served as my ambassador when i was queen
GIDDEAN DANU	senator i fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the senate
MON MOTHMA	the chancellor has played the senators well they know where the power lies and they will do whatever it takes to share in it palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it
BAIL ORGANA	we  had sit around debating any longer we have decided to do what we can to stop it senator mon mothma and i are putting together an organization  
PADME	say no more senator organa i understand at this point it will better to leave some things unsaid
BAIL ORGANA	yes i agree and we must not discuss this with anyone without everyone in this group agreeing
MON MOTHMA	that means those closest to you   even family   no one can be told
PADME	agreed
===	===
MACE	anakin skywalker we have approved your appointment to the council as the chancellor will personal representative
ANAKIN	i will do my best to uphold the principles of the jedi order
YODA	allow this appointment lightly the council does not disturbing is this move by chancellor palpatine
ANAKIN	i understand
MACE	you are on this council but we do not grant you the rank of master
ANAKIN	what  how can you do this this is outrageous it will unfair   ilet us more powerful than any of you how can you be on the council and not be a master
MACE	take a seat young skywalker
ANAKIN	forgive me master
KI-ADI-MUNDI	we have surveyed all systems in the republic and have found no sign of general grievous
YODA	hiding in the outer rim grievous is the outlying systems you must sweep
OBI-WAN	it may take some time   we do not have many ships to spare
MACE	we cannot take ships from the front line
OBI-WAN	and yet it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup
YODA	master kenobi our spies contact you must and then wait
KI-ADI-MUNDI	what about the droid attack on the wookiees
MACE	it is critical we send an attack group there immediately
OBI-WAN	he will right that is a system we cannot afford to lose it will the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant
ANAKIN	i know that system well it would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet
MACE	skywalker your assignment is here with the chancellor and kenobi must find general grievous
YODA	go i will good relations with the wookiees i have
MACE	it is settled then yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the wookiees on kashyyyk may the force be with us all
===	===
ANAKIN	what kind of nonsense is this put me on the council and not make me a master that will never been done in the history of the jedi it will insulting
OBI-WAN	calm down anakin you have been given a great honor to be on the council at your age   it will never happened before listen to me anakin the fact of the matter is you am too close to the chancellor the council doescan not like it when he interferes in jedi affairs
ANAKIN	i swear to you i didcan not ask to be put on the council  
OBI-WAN	but it will what you wanted your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off
ANAKIN	that has nothing to do with this
OBI-WAN	anakin regardless of how it happened you find yourself in a delicate situation
ANAKIN	you mean divided loyalties
OBI-WAN	i warned you there was tension between the council and the chancellor i was very clear why didcan not you listen you walked right into it
ANAKIN	the council is upset ilet us the youngest to ever serve
OBI-WAN	no it is not anakin i worry when you speak of jealousy and pride those are not jedi thoughts they am dangerous dark thoughts
ANAKIN	master you of all people should have confidence in my abilities i know where my loyalties lie
OBI-WAN	i hope so  
ANAKIN	i sense there will more to this talk than you am saying
OBI-WAN	anakin the only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you
ANAKIN	and
OBI-WAN	anakin look i am on your side i didcan not want to see you put in this situation
ANAKIN	what situation
OBI-WAN	the council wants you to report on all of the chancellor will dealings they want to know what he will up to
ANAKIN	they want me to spy on the chancellor that will treason
OBI-WAN	we are at war anakin the jedi council is sworn to uphold the principles of the republic even if the chancellor does not
ANAKIN	why didcan not the council give me this assignment when we were in session
OBI-WAN	this assignment is not to be on record the council asked me to approach you on this personally
ANAKIN	the chancellor is not a bad man obiwan he befriended me he will watched out for me ever since i arrived here
OBI-WAN	that is why you must help us anakin our allegiance is to the senate not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired
ANAKIN	master the senate demanded that he stay longer
OBI-WAN	yes but use your feelings anakin something is out of place
ANAKIN	you am asking me to do something against the jedi code against the republic against a mentor   and a friend that will what will out of place here why are you asking this of me
OBI-WAN	the council is asking you
===	===
OBI-WAN	anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm
YODA	too much under the sway of the chancellor he is much anger there is in him too much pride in his powers
MACE	it will very dangerous putting them together i docan not think the boy can handle it i docan not trust him
OBI-WAN	he have be all right i trust him with my life
MACE	i wish i did
OBI-WAN	with all due respect master is he not the chosen one is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force
MACE	so the prophecy says
YODA	a prophecy   that misread could have been
OBI-WAN	he will not let me down he never has
YODA	i hope right you are and now destroy the droid armies on kashyyyk i will may the force be with you

PADME	thank you captain
CAPTAIN TYPHO	rest well my lady
PADME	i have be up in a while
MOTEE	yes my lady
C-3PO	is there anything i might do for you my lady
PADME	yes make sure all the security droids are working thank you threepio
ANAKIN	beautiful iscan not it
PADME	you startled me
ANAKIN	how are you feeling
PADME	he keeps kicking
ANAKIN	he why do you think it will a boy
PADME	my motherly intuition
ANAKIN	whoa with a kick that strong it will got to be a girl
PADME	i heard about your appointment anakin ilet us so proud of you
ANAKIN	i may be on the council but   they refused to accept me as a jedi master
PADME	patience in time they will recognize your skills
ANAKIN	they still treat me as if i were a padawan learner  they fear my power that will the problem
PADME	anakin  
ANAKIN	sometimes i wonder what will happening to the jedi order   i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic
PADME	have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side
ANAKIN	what do you mean
PADME	what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy
ANAKIN	i docan not believe that and you am sounding like a separatist
PADME	anakin this war represents a failure to listen   now you am closer to the chancellor than anyone please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume
ANAKIN	docan not ask me to do that padme make a motion in the senate where that kind of a request belongs ilet us not your errand boy ilet us not anyone will errand boy
PADME	what is it
ANAKIN	nothing
PADME	docan not do this   docan not shut me out let me help you
ANAKIN	you  had help me   ilet us trying to help you i sense   there are things you are not telling me
PADME	i sense there are things you are not telling me hold me   like you did by the lake on naboo so long ago   when there was nothing but our love   no politics no plotting   no war
===	===
ANAKIN	you wanted to see me chancellor
DARTH SIDIOUS	yes anakin come closer i have good news our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous he is hiding in the utapau system
ANAKIN	at last we have be able to capture that monster and end this war
DARTH SIDIOUS	i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if they didcan not select you for this assignment you are the best choice by far бн but they  had always be trusted to do the right thing
ANAKIN	they try
DARTH SIDIOUS	sit down  leave us anakin you know ilet us not able to rely on the jedi council if they havecan not included you in their plot they soon will
ANAKIN	ilet us not sure i understand
DARTH SIDIOUS	you must sense what i have come to suspect   the jedi council want control of the republic   they am planning to betray me
ANAKIN	i docan not think  
DARTH SIDIOUS	anakin search your feelings you know docan not you
ANAKIN	i know they docan not trust you  
DARTH SIDIOUS	or the senate   or the republic   or democracy for that matter
ANAKIN	i have to admit my trust in them has been shaken
DARTH SIDIOUS	why they asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest didcan not they they asked you to spy on me didcan not they
ANAKIN	i docan not know   i docan not know what to say
DARTH SIDIOUS	remember back to your early teachings anakin  all those who gain power are afraid to lose it  even the jedi
ANAKIN	the jedi use their power for good
DARTH SIDIOUS	good is a point of view anakin and the jedi point of view is not the only valid one the dark lords of the sith believe in security and justice also yet they are considered by the jedi to be 
ANAKIN	  evil
DARTH SIDIOUS	  from a jedi will point of view the sith and the jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power the difference between the two is the sith are not afraid of the dark side of the force that is why they are more powerful
ANAKIN	the sith rely on their passion for their strength they think inward only about themselves
DARTH SIDIOUS	and the jedi docan not
ANAKIN	the jedi are selfless   they only care about others
DARTH SIDIOUS	or so you are been trained to believe why is it then that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong
ANAKIN	ilet us not sure it will wrong
DARTH SIDIOUS	have they asked you to betray the jedi code the constitution a friendship your own values think consider their motives keep your mind clear of assumptions the fear of losing power is a weakness of both the jedi and the sith did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis  the wise 
ANAKIN	no
DARTH SIDIOUS	i thought not it will not a story the jedi would tell you it will a sith legend darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life   he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying
ANAKIN	he could actually save people from death
DARTH SIDIOUS	the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
ANAKIN	what happened to him
DARTH SIDIOUS	he became so powerful   the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep  plagueis never saw it coming it will ironic he could save others from death but not himself
ANAKIN	is it possible to learn this power
DARTH SIDIOUS	not from a jedi
===	===
KI-ADI-MUNDI	palpatine thinks general grievous is on utapau we have had no reports of this from our agents
MACE	how could the chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it we have had contact with baron papanoida and he said no one was there
ANAKIN	a partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of utapau
YODA	act on this we must the capture of general grievous will end this war quickly and decisively we should proceed
OBI-WAN	does everyone agree
ANAKIN	the chancellor has requested that i lead the campaign
MACE	the council will make up its own mind who is to go not the chancellor
KI-ADI-MUNDI	yes this decision is ours to make
YODA	a master is needed with more experience
MACE	given our resources i recommend we send only one jedi   master kenobi
ANAKIN	he was not so successful the last time he met grievous no offense my master but ilet us only stating a fact
OBI-WAN	oh no you am quite right but i do have the most experience with his ways of combat
YODA	obiwan my choice is
KI-ADI-MUNDI	i concur master kenobi should go
YODA	i agree
MACE	very well council is adjourned obiwan prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can if this report is true there will no telling how many battle droids he may have with him
===	===
CLONE COMMANDER GREE	the droids have started up their main power generators
YODA	then now the time is commander
CLONE COMMANDER GREE	yes sir
===	===
OBI-WAN	has anakin been to see you
PADME	several times   i was so happy to hear he was accepted on the jedi council
OBI-WAN	i know   he deserves it he is impatient strong willed very opinionated but truly gifted
PADME	you am not just here to say hello something is wrong iscan not it
OBI-WAN	you should be a jedi padme
PADME	you am not very good at hiding your feelings
OBI-WAN	it will anakin   he will becoming moody and detached he will been put in a difficult position as the chancellor will representative   but i think it will more than that i was hoping he may have talked to you
PADME	why would he talk to me about his work
OBI-WAN	neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either
PADME	docan not give me that look
OBI-WAN	i know how he feels about you
PADME	what did he say
OBI-WAN	nothing he didcan not have to
PADME	i docan not know what you am talking about
OBI-WAN	i know you both too well i can see you two are in love padme ilet us worried about him i fear your relationship has confused him he will changed considerably since we returned   padme ilet us not telling the council about any of this i   i hope i didcan not upset you we am all friends i care about both of you  
PADME	thank you obiwan
OBI-WAN	please do what you can to help him
===	===
PADME	we cannot let this turn into another war
BAIL ORGANA	absolutely that is the last thing we want
MON MOTHMA	we are hoping to form an alliance in the senate to stop the chancellor from further subverting the constitution that will all
PADME	i know a jedi i feel it would be wise to consult
BANA BREEMU	that would be dangerous
MON MOTHMA	we docan not know where the jedi stand in all this
PADME	i only wish to discuss this with one   one i trust
GIDDEAN DANU	going against the chancellor without the support of the jedi is risky
PADME	the jedi arecan not any happier with the situation than we are  
CHI EEKWAY	patience senator
FANG ZAR	we have so many senators on our side surely that will pursuade the chancellor
BANA BREEMU	when you present the  petition of the two thousand  to the chancellor things may change
BAIL ORGANA	let us see what we can accomplish in the senate before we include the jedi
===	===
ANAKIN	you am going to need me on this one master
OBI-WAN	oh i agree however it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase
ANAKIN	master master i are disappointed you i have not been very appreciative of your training   i have been arrogant and i apologize   i are just been so frustrated with the council your friendship means everything to me
OBI-WAN	you are strong and wise anakin and i am very proud of you i have trained you since you were a small boy i have taught you everything i know and you have become a far greater jedi than i could ever hope to be and you have saved my life more times than i can remember but be patient anakin it will not be long before the council makes you a jedi master docan not worry i have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of utapau i think i have be able to handle the situation   even without your help
ANAKIN	well there will always a first time obiwan may the force be with you
OBI-WAN	goodbye old friend may the force be with you

ANAKIN	that will ridiculous who
DARTH SIDIOUS	no one knows who she is   only that she is a senator
ANAKIN	that will impossible i would know
DARTH SIDIOUS	sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see idle senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate ilet us sure your master will do fine

NUTE GUNRAY	safe chancellor palpatine managed to escape your grip general without count dooku i have doubts about your ability to keep us safe
GENERAL GRIEVOUS	be thankful viceroy you have not found yourself in my grip   your ship is waiting
===	===
OBI-WAN	hello there
GENERAL GRIEVOUS	general kenobi you are a bold one i find your behavior bewildering   surely you realize you am doomed  kill him enough of this back away i will deal with this jedi slime myself
OBI-WAN	your move
GENERAL GRIEVOUS	you fool i have been trained in your jedi arts by count dooku himself attack kenobi
OBI-WAN	you forget i trained the jedi that defeated count dooku i may not defeat your droids but my troops certainly will
GENERAL GRIEVOUS	army or not you must realize you are doomed
OBI-WAN	i docan not think so
===	===
PALPATINE	nee alavar fang zar maledee sweitt concorkill and mon calamari anakin stands to one side of palpatine
DARTH SIDIOUS	i understand your reservations completely senator and i assure you the appointment of governors will in no way compete with the duties of the senate
PADME	may i take it then that there will be no further amendments to the constitution
DARTH SIDIOUS	i want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do my lady and when it does i guarantee an immediate return to democracy  
PADME	you are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war then
DARTH SIDIOUS	you must trust me to do the right things senator that is why i am here
FANG ZAR	but surely  
DARTH SIDIOUS	i have said i will do what is right that should be enough for your   committee
PADME	on behalf of the  delegation of two thousand  i thank you chancellor
DARTH SIDIOUS	i thank you for bringing this to my attention senator their sincerity is to be admired although i sense there is more to their request than they are telling us
ANAKIN	what do you mean
DARTH SIDIOUS	they are not to be trusted
ANAKIN	surely senator amidala can be trusted  
DARTH SIDIOUS	these are unstable times for the republic anakin some see instability as an opportunity senator amidala is hiding something i can see it in her eyes
ANAKIN	ilet us sure you am mistaken
DARTH SIDIOUS	ilet us surprised your jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things
ANAKIN	i simply docan not sense betrayal in senator amidala
DARTH SIDIOUS	yes you do but you docan not seem to want to admit it there is much conflict in you anakin
===	===
CLONE COMMANDER CODY	master windu may i interrupt general kenobi has made contact with general grievous and we
MACE WINDU	thank you commander anakin deliver this report to the chancellor his reaction will give us a clue to his
ANAKIN	yes master
MACE WINDU	i sense a plot to destroy the jedi the dark side of the force surrounds the chancellor
KI-ADI-MUNDI	if he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of grievous then he should be removed from
MACE WINDU	that could be a dangerous move   the jedi council would have to take control of the senate in order to secure a peaceful transition  
KI-ADI-MUNDI	  and replace the congress with senators who are not filled with greed and corruption
YODA	to a dark place this line of thought will carry us hmmmmm   great care we must take
===	===
ANAKIN	chancellor we have just received a report from master kenobi he has engaged general grievous
DARTH SIDIOUS	we can only hope that master kenobi is up to the challenge
ANAKIN	i should be there with him
DARTH SIDIOUS	it is upsetting to me to see that the council doescan not seem to fully appreciate your talents docan not you wonder why they will not make you a jedi master
ANAKIN	i wish i knew more and more i get the feeling that i am being excluded from the council i know there are things about the force that they are not telling me
DARTH SIDIOUS	they docan not trust you anakin they see your future they know your power will be too strong to control anakin you must break through the fog of lies the jedi have created around you let me help you to know the subtleties of the force
ANAKIN	how do you know the ways of the force
DARTH SIDIOUS	my mentor taught me everything about the force   even the nature of the dark side
ANAKIN	you know the dark side
DARTH SIDIOUS	anakin if one is to understand the great mystery one must study all its aspects not just the dogmatic narrow view of the jedi if you wish to become a complete and wise leader you must embrace a larger view of the force be careful of the jedi anakin  they fear you in time they will destroy you let me train you
ANAKIN	i will not be a pawn in your political game the jedi are my family
DARTH SIDIOUS	only through me can you achieve a power greater than any jedi learn to know the dark side of the force anakin and you will be able to save your wife from certain death
ANAKIN	what did you say
DARTH SIDIOUS	use my knowledge i beg you  
ANAKIN	you am a sith lord
DARTH SIDIOUS	i know what has been troubling you   listen to me docan not continue to be a pawn of the jedi council ever since i are known you you are been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary jedi   a life of significance of conscience
ANAKIN	you am wrong
DARTH SIDIOUS	are you going to kill me
ANAKIN	i would certainly like to
DARTH SIDIOUS	i know you would i can feel your anger it gives you focus makes you stronger
ANAKIN	i am going to turn you over to the jedi council
DARTH SIDIOUS	of course you should but you am not sure of their intentions are you what if i am right and they are plotting to take over the republic
ANAKIN	i will quickly discover the truth of all this
DARTH SIDIOUS	you have great wisdom anakin know the power of the dark side the power to save padme i am not going anywhere you have time to decide my fate perhaps you have reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all  
===	===
GENERAL GRIEVOUS	prepare to move out of orbit i will be up in a few moments

MACE WINDU	a sith lord
ANAKIN	yes the one we have been looking for
MACE WINDU	how do you know this
ANAKIN	he knows the ways of the force he has been trained to use the dark side
MACE WINDU	are you sure
ANAKIN	absolutely
MACE WINDU	then our worst fears have been realized we must move quickly if the jedi order is to survive
ANAKIN	master the chancellor is very powerful you will need my help if you are going to arrest him
MACE WINDU	for your own good stay out of this affair i sense a great deal of confusion in you young skywalker there is much fear that clouds your judgment
ANAKIN	i must go master
